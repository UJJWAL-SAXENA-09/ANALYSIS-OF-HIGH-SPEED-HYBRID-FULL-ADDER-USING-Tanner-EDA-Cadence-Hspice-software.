## Abstract
In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, the performance of multipliers directly influences the overall system speed, particularly in DSP devices. This project explores a high-speed hybrid full adder design using Shannon adder logic, aiming to reduce both power consumption and propagation delay. Simulations have been conducted using Tanner EDA, Cadence, and Hspice, yielding promising results in terms of power-delay product compared to advanced CMOS technologies.

## Features
- High-speed multiplication for faster performance in DSP devices.
- Low power consumption due to optimized hybrid adder logic.
- Reduced transistor count for greater efficiency.
- Simulation and design using advanced EDA tools.

## Methodology

### Existing Method
A XOR-XNOR circuit provides full-swing XOR-XNOR outputs without the need for external inverters. This method uses feedback circuitry and an internal NOT gate but suffers from increased area and delay.

### Proposed Method
The hybrid adder is designed using Shannon adder logic, focusing on reducing power consumption and propagation delay. Simulations demonstrate that this design is superior to traditional CMOS adders in terms of speed and power efficiency.
